Title: Building a Website with Webby
Subtitle: How to turn Webby into the perfect blog engine

My previous blog was generated by [Webby][webby], a neat micro-CMS built by Tim
Pease. It's a lovely piece of Ruby which was a perfect fit for my blog:

* **I wanted to write my blog posts in TextMate, right on my
  desktop.** This makes it really easy to copy text around, and it takes no
  time to save my work (no need to worry about closing the wrong tab or window).

* **The blog should handle large traffic very well.** I'm so tired of meeting
  503's all the time. 99% of the time a blog will show the exact same
  content, so it shouldn't be hard to "scale".

* **It should be hackable.** Every blog has different needs and you shouldn't
  need to change the source code directly. Some sort of plugin system or monkey
  patching would be appreciated.

## Editing

With Webby *you* decide how you would write your site. Since everything is just
plain text files, you can use Vim, Emacs, TextMate or even Notepad. At the top
of each page you can define some metadata:

    ---
    title:      Building a Website with Webby
    created_at: 2008-02-25 22:45:43.134435 +01:00
    filter:
      - fn
      - uv
      - textile
    ---
{: lang=yaml }

The `title` and `created_at` is only used by me, while Webby uses the filters
to format the content. The Textile-filter is bundled with Webby, while the `uv`
and `fn` filters are written by me.

## Speed of Light

Since Webby simply generates static files, they will be served directly by
Apache by the speed of light! After a simple `webby deploy`, the blog is
getting rebuilt and deployed to the server (using rsync). Simple and efficient.

## Hacks!

However, the best thing about Webby is probably that it's dead simple to
extend. You can easily create new filters and thanks to Ruby, you can also
easily monkey patch anything. Webby automatically includes all the files in the
`lib`-folder, so there's no need to edit the source directly.

For instance, I wasn't satisfied with the way Textile showed the footnotes, so
I added my own footnote-filter like this:

    Webby::Filters.register :fn do |input|
      # If you add `fn` to filters, Webby will run this piece of code where
      # `input` contains the content and the return value is what it will
      # be replaced with.
      input.gsub!(/fn(\d+)\. ([^\n]+)/) do |s|
        "<li id=\"fn#{$1}\"><sup>#{$1}</sup> #{$2}</li>"
      end
      li = '<li id="fn\d+.*?</li>'
      input.sub(/#{li}([\n\040]+#{li})*/, '<ul class="footnotes">\0</ul>')
    end
{: lang=ruby }

I also wanted to use Ultraviolet for syntax highlighting:

    Webby::Filters.register :uv do |input|
      input.gsub(%r{<syntax( lang="(\w+)")?>(.*?)</syntax>}m) do |s|
        if $2
         "<notextile>" + Uv.parse($3, "xhtml", $2, false, "sunburst") + "</notextile>"
        else 
          "<pre>#{$3}</pre>"
        end 
      end
    end
{: lang=ruby }

## index.txt

After you've mastered the editing, and maybe even created some nifty filters,
you want to create an index page. Webby makes this very easy: the variable
`@pages` returns an instance of `Webby::PagesDB` and `@pages.find` makes
it dead simple to find the pages you want:

    ---
    filter:
      - erb
    ---
    
    <% pages = @pages.find(:limit => :all,
                           :in_directory => 'posts',
                           :sort_by => 'created_at').reverse
       # I want to show the first page differently:
       first = pages.shift %>
    
    <h2 id="first"><a href="<%= first.url %>"><%= first.title %></a></h2>
    <%= first.render %>

    <% pages.each do |page| %>
      <h2><a href="<%= page.url %>"><%= page.title %></a></h2>
    <% end %>

{: lang=yaml }

## Feedalicious

In these busy days you can't run a blog without providing a feed. Since a feed
is basically just a XML-file (just like your blog posts are just a HTML-file),
we can use Webby's ERB-filter to find the pages and just generate it just the
way we generated the index page.

Have a look at [my atom feed][my-atom] if you need something to build upon.

## Conclusion

Webby is still my favourite blog engine; the reason I built
[Timeless](/timeless) was because I no longer wanted a traditional blog. That
said, it should be mentioned that it's been a while since the latest release of
Webby, and maybe [Nanoc][nanoc] is a better solution for you.
