Title: JSON: The JavaScript subset that isn't
Author: judofyr

From Wikipedia's article on [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)

All these years we've heard it over and over again: "JSON is a
JavaScript subset". Guess what? They're wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. You
see, the devil's in the details, and there's no way to avoid it: Not
*all* JSON-formatted text is legal JavaScript code:

    {"JSON":"ro cks!"}

(snip)

Copy the *exact* code above and paste it into Firebug or the Web Inspector
within a pair of parentheses (required to avoid an ambiguity in JavaScript's
syntax):

Wait, what? `SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL`? That doesn't make any
sense! It's just a regular object literal, how can *that* be a SyntaxError?

Try the same code in a proper JSON parser. No problems at all.

Of course it's not *just* a regular object literal. There's a sneaky little
Unicode character in there too: Right between "ro" and "cks!" there's a tiny
**U+2028**. Your browser probably doesn't display it because it's whitespace:
[LINE SEPARATOR][u2028], but it's still there. If you replace the character
with a U+2029 ([PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR][u2029]) you would have the exact same
issue.

## JSON + U+2028 = ☺

According to the JSON specification, you can safely use this character in any
string. It's not a quote, not a backslash, and not a *control character*.  It's
just a weird Unicode whitespace character:

## JavaScript + U+2028 = ☹

ECMA-262 (the standard that JavaScript is based on) on the other hand defines
strings a little differently: According to [7.8.4 String Literals][strlit], a
string can contain anything as long as it's not a quote, a backslash or a
*line terminator*:

    DoubleStringCharacter ::
        SourceCharacter but not double-quote " or backslash \ or LineTerminator 
        \ EscapeSequence

    SingleStringCharacter ::
        SourceCharacter but not single-quote ' or backslash \ or LineTerminator 
        \ EscapeSequence

And what is a line terminator? Let's have a look at [7.3 Line
Terminators][lineterm]:

> The following characters are consider to be line terminators:
> 
> * `\u000A` - Line Feed
> * `\u000D` - Carriage Return
> * `\u2028` - Line separator
> * `\u2029` - Paragraph separator

Ouch.

No string in JavaScript can contain a literal U+2028 or a U+2029.

## So what?

Because of these two invisible Unicode characters, JSON is **not** a subset of
JavaScript. Close, but no cigar.

In most applications, you won't notice this issue. First of all, the line
separator and the paragraph separator isn't exactly widely used. Secondly, any
*proper* JSON parser will have no problems with parsing it.

However, when you're dealing with [JSONP][jsonp] there's no way around: You're
forced to use the JavaScript parser in the browser. And if you're sending data
that other have entered, a tiny U+2028 or U+2029 might sneak in and break your
pretty cross-domain API.

## The solution

Luckily, the solution is simple: If we look at the JSON specification we see
that the *only* place where a U+2028 or U+2029 can occur is in a string.
Therefore we can simply replace every U+2028 with `\u2028` (the escape
sequence) and U+2029 with `\u2029` whenever we need to send out some JSONP.

It's already been [fixed in Rack::JSONP][jsonp-win] and I encourage all
frameworks or libraries that send out JSONP to do the same. It's a one-line
patch in most languages and the result is still 100% valid JSON.
