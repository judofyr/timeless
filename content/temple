I have a theory:

> Every compilable template can be compiled to ERB.

Well, not ERB-the-syntax, but ERB-the-concept:

> Every compilable template consists of three elements:
> 
> * Static text
> * Dynamic text (pieces of Ruby which are evaluated and sent to the client)
> * Blocks (pieces of Ruby which are evaluated and _not_ sent to the
>   client, but might change the control flow).

Nothing revolutionary at all. Just a theory.

## Compiling it

There are several ways to render such a template, but the fastest one is to
compile it to pure Ruby:

    Hello <%= @world %>!
    <% if @me.happy? %>
      <%= @greeting %>
    <% end %>
{: lang=html_rails }

Becomes:

    _buf = []
    _buf << "Hello "
    _buf << (@world)
    _buf << "!\n"
    if @me.happy?
    _buf << "\n  "
    _buf << (@greeting)
    _buf << "\n"
    end
    _buf.join
{: lang=ruby }

You probably also want to optimize it:

    _buf = []
    _buf << ("Hello #{@world}!\n")
    if @me.happy?
    _buf << ("\n  #{@greeting}\n")
    end
    _buf.join
{: lang=ruby }

Or maybe you rather want `_buf` to be a String? Or print it directly to
stdout?

These options are already written and implemented in Erubis, but none of
the other template engines can take advantage of that. Which is a shame,
because we know that every compilable template can be compiled to ERB. So
*technically* it shouldn't be a problem to share such code.

## Abstractions

The problem with today's template engines is that they aren't using enough abstractions. The first version of Mustache parsed and compiled at the same time. Haml does parsing/compiling/optimization in some tightly coupled modules. Parkaby separates parsing and compiling, but could share a lot of code with Haml since they're both compiling HTML tags. While I haven't checked it out, I assume the same applies to [RuHL][ruhl]. Liquid doesn't really compile (to Ruby) at all, but rather uses a VM approach.

Every template developers faces the same questions: Should I use an Array
or String as buffer? How should I escape it? How can I optimize it? Or,
they don't even compile it at all.

## Enter the Temple

[Temple][temple] attempts to solve these problems. Your goal as a template developer is to end up with an Array like this:

    [:multi,
     [:static, "Hello "],
     [:dynamic, "@world"],
     [:static, "!\n"],
     [:block, "if @me.happy?"],
     [:static, "\n  "],
     [:dynamic, "@greeting"],
     [:static, "\n"],
     [:block, "end"]]
{: lang=ruby }

Then let Temple take over. You could use Temple::Filters::DynamicInliner to
optimize sequential statics/dynamics into a single dynamic.
Temple::Filters::Escapable handles escaping, and Temple::Core::ArrayBuffer
generates the Ruby code.

The idea is to build an engine based on a chain of compilers. A compiler is
simply a class which has a method called _#compile_ which takes one
arguments. It's illegal for a compiler to mutate the argument, and it
should be possible to use the same instance several times.

Very much like you have middlewares in Rack, you use compilers in Temple
(except _everything_ is a compiler in Temple):

    class ERBEngine < Temple::Engine
      use Temple::Parsers::ERB
      use Temple::Filters::DynamicInliner
      use Temple::Core::ArrayBuffer
    end  
{: lang=ruby }

## Step 1: The parser

In Temple, a parser is also a compiler, because a compiler is just
something that takes some input and produces some output. A parser is then
something that takes a String and returns an Array.

A dead simple ERB parser could look like this:

    class ERB
      def compile(src)
        result = [:multi]
        while src =~ /<%(.*?)%>/
          result << [:static, $`]
          case $1[0]
          when ?#
            next
          when ?=
            text = $1[1..-1].strip
            head = :dynamic
          else
            text = $1
            head = :block
          end
          result << [head, text]
          src = $'
        end
        result << [:static, src]
        result
      end
    end
{: lang=ruby }

It's important to remember that the _parser should be dumb._ No
optimization, no guesses. It should produce an Array that is as close to
the source as possible. That means you'll probably have to invent your own
abstraction, but _that is exactly the point!_

The Mustache parser compiles to an Array like this:

    [:multi,
      [:static, "Hello "],
      [:mustache, :evar, :world],
      [:mustache, :section, :happy?, 
        [:mustache, :evar, :greeting]]]
{: lang=ruby }

And that's fine. The parser should not care about how to compile this
further down. That's the job to a _filter_.

## Step N: Filters

A filter is a compiler which takes an Array and returns an Array. It might
turn convert it one step closer to the core-abstraction, it might create a
new abstraction, or it might just optimize in the current abstraction.
Ultimately, it's still just a compiler which takes an Array and returns an
Array.

Temple::_Filters_::Mustache takes an Array in the Mustache-abstraction and
compiles it down to core. Then it has to be ran through
Temple::Filters::Escapable which handles HTML escaping.

You might wonder _why_ we split Mustache into a parser and a filter, and
there are several reasons. Basically it's because the parser shouldn't need
to worry about the code it should generate. Now it's possible to benchmark,
rewrite, test and improve the parser, and the parser only.

It's also because there isn't one definite way to go from a Mustache-string
to the core-abstraction, but there is only one way to go from a Mustache
string to the Mustache-abstraction. If we want to experiment with another
way of ending up at core, we can now write it without duplicating the
parsing code.

Anyway, after you've run it through a few filters, you probably want to
generate some Ruby code, and that's what a generator does. 

## Step N+1: The generator

A generator is a compiler which takes an Array and returns a String.
Generators, just like parsers, are dumb too. Here's the ArrayBuffer:

    class ArrayBuffer < Generator
      def buffer(str = '')
        '_buf' + str
      end
      
      def preamble;  buffer " = []\n" end
      def postamble; buffer ".join"   end
      
      def on_static(text)
        buffer " << #{text.inspect}\n"
      end
      
      def on_dynamic(code)
        buffer " << (#{code})\n"
      end
      
      def on_block(code)
        code + "\n"
      end
    end
{: lang=ruby }

Temple includes Array, StringBuffer and Interpolation too, even though the last one works kinda funky with blocks and currently only works as expected with Mustache.

## Engines

The user however would only see an engine, which is a chain of compilers: 

    class ERBEngine < Temple::Engine
      # Here using some helpers, but it's important to remember that
      # it's only sugar around the #use method shown above.
      parser :ERB
      filter :DynamicInliner
      generator :ArrayBuffer
    end  
{: lang=ruby }

The core of Temple::Engine is simple. So simple I'd like to show it to you
(without the helpers):

    class Engine
      def self.filters
        @filters ||= []
      end
      
      def self.use(filter, *args, &blk)
        filters << [filter, args, blk]
      end
      
      def initialize
        @chain = self.class.filters.map do |filter, args, blk|
          filter.new(*args, &blk)
        end
      end
      
      def compile(thing)
        @chain.inject(thing) { |prev_thing, compiler| compiler.compile(prev_thing) }
      end
    end
{: lang=ruby }

No magic at all (as long as you understand how inject works). I really like
how Temple contains many small pieces which does one thing, and they all
easily stacks up and produce some fairy good Ruby code.

## Another abstraction: Haml and HTML

Okay, so I've shown you two examples: ERB which compiles directly to core,
and Mustache which uses one abstraction. Now let's have a look at Haml.

Because Haml is so complex, going directly to core can be difficult.
Instead it might be smart to introduce an HTML-abstraction:

    [:multi,
      [:html, :tag,
        :a,
        [:basicattr, :href, "http://judofyr.net/"],
        [:static, "Magnus Holm's blog"]]]  
{: lang=ruby }

There can be several HTML-compilers. One aims for speed (Haml's ugly
option), one that aims for pretty indentation (Haml's pretty option). And I
can use the same compiler in Parkaby. If one of these compilers improves
and generates better code, it's going to improve performance in both Haml
and Parkaby. Performance wars are going to be so boring!

Nathan Weizenbaum (the maintainer of Haml) told me targeting Haml could be
difficult, but I'm quite optimistic. It's better to try, fail and learn,
than not try at all. And to be honest, I'm willing to bend things around to
make Haml a happy citizen in Temple.

I'd also love to see how Liquid can fit into this mix.

## The goal

So what do I want with all this? I want to experiment! I want to see if
it's possible to improve on the lowest level of the abstractions, and I'd
like to see how it affects the upper layers. I'd like to learn more about
different template engines; how they work, how they are parsed, how they
perform. I simply want to learn. And I want to share the knowledge.

I want people to experiment and create new concepts in templating. I want
to see Domain-Specific Template-Languages. I want people to realize that
creating a template engine is just like creating a programming language,
just on a smaller scale. Testing frameworks are so boring, why don't try to
create The Perfect Template Language™?

And, of course, I want *fast* template engines that shares code which each
other.

But in the end, it's just an experiment. Maybe it's successful, probably
not, it doesn't matter so much as long as I have fun.

## Join the fun!

I'm the dumb one here, and if you know _anything_ about template engines
I'd love to hear your thoughts on Temple. In fact, I'd love to hear
_everybody's_ thoughts on Temple!

If you're interested, please join [the mailing list][ml]. The documentation
is pretty non-existing at the moment, if there are any questions at all,
please do not hesitate to ask.
