Title: Abstraction Creep
Subtitle: 
Author: judofyr

Abstractions are very powerful when you're writing software. You don't
want to write your web applications in assembly, or an operating system
in JavaScript for that matter. Choosing the right abstraction makes you
focus on the real challenges and lets you forget the insignificant
details.

Not all abstractions are perfect. Some are leaky; some are just plain
stupid. But wait! We can just introduce an abstraction on top of that,
right? Let's hide the stupid details and provide a new, better
abstraction!

*Abstraction creep* is what happens when you try to save yourself from a
shaky abstraction by introducing *another* abstraction, instead of just
fixing that goddamn abstraction.

(snip)

I'm going to use examples from Ruby and Ruby on Rails, but I think the
examples are clear enough for any programmer to understand. Please
[contact](/comments) me if something is unclear.

## Controller tests

Controller tests in Rails are slow. Or, more correctly: Starting the
environment where you can run controller tests in Rails takes time.
We're talking 5-10 seconds here. 10 seconds doesn't sound so bad, but
when you're trying to quickly iterate over test/code, waiting 10 seconds
before getting any feedback kills your flow. 

Well, luckily we can introduce another abstraction!

### The old code

    class PicturesController < ApplicationController
      before_filter :required_login
      
      def create
        @picture = current_user.pictures.create(params[:picture])
        if @picture.persisted?
          redirect_to @picture
        else
          render :action => :edit
        end
      end
    end
{: lang=ruby }

### Let's Objectify!

Let's use [Objectify](https://github.com/bitlove/objectify) to make this
controller more testable.

First, we separate out the filter:

    class RequiresLoginPolicy
      def allowed?(current_user) 
        !current_user.nil?
      end
    end
{: lang=ruby }

Then, the actual action:

    class PicturesCreateService
      def call(current_user, params)
        current_user.pictures.create params[:picture]
      end
    end
{: lang=ruby }

And finally, the rendering:

    class PicturesCreateResponder
      def call(service_result, controller, renderer)
        if service_result.persisted?
          renderer.redirect_to service_result
        else
          renderer.data(service_result)
          renderer.render :action => :edit
        end
      end
    end
{: lang=ruby }

Now we can test each of these three classes without loading Rails. Woah,
super fast tests! They're even *unit* tests; only testing a single step
of the flow, so your tests become simpler too.

Win/win, right?

### Let's take a step back

What have we actually done here?

We've created our own abstraction on top of Rails'
request/response-loop. Is it useful? Yes, we can now focus on smaller
units. Does it have some problems? Yes, you can't easily test the way
the units actually work in production. Is it more complex? Hell, yes. We
have more classes, more methods, more `end`s, more lines of code.

Is it worth it? I doubt it.

### Fixing the abstraction

Okay, so what's the real problem here?

Controller tests are slow. Why?

Because loading controllers are slow. Why?

Because controllers are too complex; they depend on too many different
parts of Rails which needs to be loaded at startup.

Why are controllers complex? A controller is rather simple:

* It takes a request and an empty response
* It lets you define actions which change the response
* It defines some convenience methods

These are the most important features. Let's write a very simple
controller:

    class BasicController
      def initialize(request, responder)
        @request = request
        @responder = response
      end

      def params
        @request.params
      end

      def render(*args)
        @responder.render(*args)
      end

      def redirect_to(*args)
        @responder.redirect_to(*args)
      end
      
      # and so on...
    end

    # Our previous code:
    class PicturesController < BasicController
      def current_user; ... end

      def create
        @picture = current_user.pictures.create(params[:picture])
        if @picture.persisted?
          redirect_to @picture
        else
          render :action => :edit
        end
      end
    end
{: lang=ruby }

No dependencies (i.e. no other files/classes to load), no magic. Super
fast tests again:

    test "uploading a new picture" do
      request = Request.new(:params => { :picture => { ... } })
      responder = MockResponder.new
      
      picture = PicturesController.new(request, responder)
      picture.create

      assert response.redirected_to /^/pictures/(\d+)/
      # or whatever we want to assert for
    end
{: lang=ruby }

Notice that I'm using the regular Request class. Creating Request
objects should be just as easy as creating a new controller object. They
are both very simple classes that have few dependencies.

### What about filters?

You might have noticed that I silently dropped the before_filter in the
last example. This was intentional because *filters are not crucial to
what a controller is doing*. That doesn't mean they don't belong there,
it just means you need to figure out if it's worth the added complexity.

Does it belong another place? Maybe in the router (yes, there are
frameworks that do the filtering in the router)? Somewhere else? I don't
know. Maybe filters are lightweight and useful enough to take up some
controller complexity.

And *this* is what we should focus on: Figuring out what belongs in the
most basic classes in our framework. Not creating a horrible patchwork
by adding more abstractions.

### Disclaimer

Just to make it clear: This is by no means an argument against Objectify
itself, just the part where they introduce another layer on top of
ActionController. The concept of service objects *does* make sense in
more complex applications, but I believe it's possible to achieve it
within the current abstractions exposed by Rails.

## Models

Models in Rails have the same problem as controllers: They are too
complex. Too many dependencies.

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    end
{: lang=ruby }

It looks so simple, but in reality it's a complicated beast:

* You need a database connection to just instantiate it (!)
* The table "posts" needs to exists in the database
* It adds a bunch of methods

Models in Rails works great as long as you're using them inside Rails'
request/response-loop where everything is set up for you. The moment you
step out from that loop (tests, other libraries) it's a big hassle.

It's very tempting to add abstractions on top of ActiveRecord to make it
easier to work with. Or you could fix the abstraction by using the [Data
Mapper][datamapper] pattern instead.

## Strive for simple data objects

Abstraction creep often occurs when the data objects are too complex.
And there's *nothing* about data that makes it complex. Data is really,
really simple. There's only two things you need to do with data:

1. You need to be able to combine data into one structure
2. You need to be able to take apart the data again

If you're not able to do those things easily, you've already lost the
war. When the data is difficult to work with, you're forced to add
abstractions, dependency-injection, mocks, stubs, and whatnot. Instead
of just working with the actual data, you'll have to abstract away the
data.

Please be aware that this is by no means "incompatible" with
object-oriented programming. You can still get your precious information
hiding. You can still override accessors so the interface you expose
isn't the same as the internal interface. You can still subclass your
data objects. You can still add convenience methods for working with the
data.

You just have to make it effortless to do the two most important things:

1. Construct the data object
2. Access the data it's composed of

As long as you can do this (hopefully with no dependencies at all),
you can actually use your data objects in other classes. In fact, it
*encourages you* to create separate classes for separate problems. When
you can easily use your data objects it's even easier to separate
functionality to other classes (as opposed to adding more functionality
to the same class).

## Sometimes change is imminent

Of course, using complex data objects is far from the only way to create
shaky abstractions. Sometimes we don't even realize it's flawed until
it's too late. Or maybe the world changes in such way that it
invalidates the abstraction.

Rack is a typical example of an abstraction that hasn't handled change
well. Rack is tries to abstract away HTTP in a simple and clear way.
When Rack was introduced in 2007, the web was pretty much stateless and
every request expected an response as soon as possible. A synchronous
interface makes sense:

    # When the web server sees a request it runs this:
    env = build_env_from_request
    status, headers, body = App.call(env)
    server_response(status, headers, body)
{: lang=ruby }

The web has *changed*. Suddenly you have long-polling, where the request
can wait for uptil 30 seconds before the server returns a response. We
have WebSockets which completely breaks the stateless
request/response-cycle. The requirements has changed.

Rack wasn't designed to handle these issues, so another abstraction was
built on top:

    def App.call(env)
      cb = env['async.callback']

      # Async call
      wait_for_long_polling do
        # Now we can return the request!
        cb.call(200, {}, [])
      end

      # Send a dummy "response" in order to be "complient" with the Rack
      # abstraction.
      [-1, {}, []]
    end
{: lang=ruby }

This is a horrible, hacky abstraction, implemented by some Ruby web servers
(outside of the Rack specification). Not only does it *look* weird, it also
breaks the the whole Rack abstraction. Any layer between the web server and the
application (that follows the Rack specification) will behave incorrectly when
it sees the dummy response.

You can't predict the future, and some abstractions are perfect until
the future comes and ruins everything.

## Sustain the pain; go with the flow. Or: deal with the real problem.

Sometimes you're stuck with crappy abstractions. ActiveRecord isn't
perfect. ActionController has its problem. You *will* feel a slight pain
when you're forced to use them in a way don't like. It's very tempting
to just add another abstraction. It can't harm, right?

Personally, I try to *avoid* these abstractions-of-abstractions
for as long as possible. I find that the complexity introduced is hardly
worth the advantages. I can accept some slow tests. I can work around
annoyances. All in the name of simplicity, consistency and familiarity.

Maybe you'll reach a point of anger. You can no longer handle the pain.
Or maybe the abstraction is just impossible to work around (you can't do
long-polling efficiently in Rack without changing anything). If that
happens, you might be better served to **rewrite the current (shaky)
abstraction, instead of building another layer in an already-unstable
foundation**.

When you decide to abstract away the abstraction, it means you have the
**competence to realize that the abstraction is wrong, but not the
courage to fix the actual problem**. Your choice might seem sensible now
(easier to integrate with the old abstraction; less changes overall),
but 5 months, 5 years or even 50 years from now, people are going to
say: "Why do I have to care about this stuff? Why couldn't you just have
fixed the goddamn problem?"
